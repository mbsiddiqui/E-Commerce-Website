            <strong>All defined terms used below shall have the meanings set forth in Our Terms and Conditions. See 
                <a href="terms and conditions.html">Terms and Conditions</a>.</strong><br>
            <br>
            
            This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how information about You is collected, used, and disclosed by Your
            access or use of this Site or otherwise as a result of Your interactions with Us. By visiting this Site
            directly or through another site, You accept the terms and conditions of this Policy. This Policy applies to
            this Site. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices on any website not operated by Us to
            which this Site links or that links to this Site. <br>
            <br>

            We respect children’s privacy. We do not knowingly or intentionally collect personal information from
            children under age 13. Elsewhere on the Site, you have represented and warranted that you are either 18
            years of age or using the Site with the supervision of a parent or guardian. If you are under the age of 13,
            please do not submit any personal information to Us, and rely on a parent or guardian to assist you. <br>
            <br>


            <strong>Information Collection</strong><br>

            We collect information from you in several different ways on this Site. <br>
            <br>

            <i>Registration and Ordering</i><br>

            Before using certain portions of this Site or ordering products, you may be required to complete an online
            registration form. During registration, you will be asked to provide to Us certain personal information,
            including but not limited to your name, shipping and billing address(es), phone number, email address,
            gender, and credit card number. In addition, We may also ask you for your country of residence and/or your
            organization’s country of operation, so we can comply with applicable laws and regulations. These kinds of
            personal information are used for billing purposes, to fulfill your orders, to communicate with you about
            your order and the Sites, and for internal marketing purposes. If We encounter a problem when processing
            your order, your personal information may be used to contact you. <br>
            <br>

            <i>Information We Collect Automatically</i><br>

            We may also automatically collect information about you when you access or use the Site or transact business
            with Us, including: <br>

            <strong>Transaction Information:</strong> When you purchase or return a product, We collect information about the
            transaction, such as product details, purchase price, and the date and location of the transaction. <br>

            <strong>Log Information:</strong> We obtain information about your use of Our websites, including the type of browser you
            use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the page you visited before navigating to this Site. <br>

            <strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access Our
            Services, such as the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers, mobile
            network information, and browsing behavior. <br>

            <strong>Location Information:</strong> We may collect information about the precise location of your device when you consent
            to the collection of this information. We may also collect information about your approximate location each
            time you access this Site. <br>

            <strong>Information Collected by Cookies and other Tracking Technologies:</strong> We may use cookies, web beacons, and other
            tracking technologies to collect information about you and your interaction with this Site, including
            information about your browsing behavior, purchase behavior, and other engagement with the Services. We use
            this information in one or more of the ways described in the "Use of Information" section below. Most web
            browsers are set to accept cookies by default, but you can usually change your browser settings to remove or
            reject cookies. <br>
            <br>

            <i>Information We Collect from Other Sources</i><br>

            We may also receive information about you from other sources and combine or link that with information We
            have about you. For example, We may collect demographic and change-of-address information from third party
            sources and information from third party social media platforms (such as Facebook) if you log into this Site
            using your social media account credentials or if you make certain content and information publicly
            available, such as photos, videos, and profile information. <br>
            <br>


            <strong> Information Use and Disclosure</strong><br>
            <br>

            <i>Internal Use</i><br>

            We use your personal information to process your order and provide you with customer service. We may
            internally your personal information to improve this Site’s content and layout, to improve outreach and for
            Our own marketing efforts (including marketing our services and products to you), and to determine general
            marketplace information about visitors to this Site. <br>
            <br>


            <i> Communications with You</i><br>

            We will use your personal information to communicate with you about this Site and your orders and
            deliveries. Also, We may send you a confirmation email when you register with Us. We may send you a
            service-related announcement on the rare occasions when it is necessary (for example, if we must temporarily
            suspend our service for maintenance.) Also, you may submit your email address for reasons such as to
            register for a contest or sweepstakes or to sign up for email newsletters and special offers. If you submit
            your email address, We use it to deliver the information to you. We always permit you to unsubscribe or opt
            out of future emails. Because We have to communicate with you about orders that you choose to place, you
            cannot opt out of receiving emails related to your orders. <br>
            <br>


            <i> External Use</i><br>

            Except as otherwise set forth below, We do not sell, rent, trade, license or otherwise disclose your
            specific personal information or financial information to anyone. <br>

            We may disclose information to third parties that perform specific functions on Our behalf. However, We will
            only disclose the information that is necessary for them to perform their service. <br>

            We must provide your credit card number to financial-services corporations such as credit-card processors
            and issuers as is required to process your orders. We will use industry standard security measures,
            including data encryption, when providing your credit card number to others. <br>

            We may disclose personal information or financial information in response to requests from law enforcement
            officials conducting investigations; subpoenas; a court order; or if We are otherwise required to disclose
            such information by law. We also will release personal information where disclosure is necessary to protect
            our legal rights, enforce our Terms and Conditions or other agreements, or to protect ourselves or others.
            For example, We may share information to reduce the risk of fraud or if someone uses or attempts to use this
            Site for illegal reasons or to commit fraud. <br>

            While We will not sell (or trade or rent) personally identifiable information to other companies as part of
            Our regular course of business. However, it’s possible that We might acquire or merge with or be acquired by
            another company or that We might dispose of some or all of Our assets. If that happens, your personal
            information may be disclosed to another company, but that disclosure will be subject to the Privacy Policy
            in effect. <br>

            We may share non-personal information (such as the number of daily visitors to a particular web page, or the
            size of an order placed on a certain date) with third parties such as advertising partners. This information
            does not directly personally identify you or any user. <br>
            <br>


            <i> Data Security</i><br>

            We take reasonable measures, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to protect
            information about you from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and
            destruction.<br>
            <br>

            <i> Opt Out/Corrections</i><br>

            Upon your request, We will (a) correct or update your personal information; (b) stop sending emails to your
            email address; and/or (c) disable your account to prevent any future purchases through that account. You can
            make these requests by emailing Us at 
            <a href="mailto:robertbilal123@gmail.com?subject=Redirection from Privacy Policy Page">support@e-commerce.com</a>. <br>

            Please do not email your credit-card number or other sensitive information. <br>
            <br>


            <i> Offline Collection Use and Disclosure</i><br>

            We also may collect information offline. We will treat any information collected offline in a manner that is
            consistent with this Policy. One example involves someone calling Us to place an order or to ask questions.
            When someone calls, We will ask only for the personal information We need in order to place the order or to
            answer the question. When We need to store information (such as order information), We will enter it into
            our database. <br>
            <br>

            <i> Updates to this Policy</i><br>

            If We change or update this Privacy Policy, We will post changes and updates on the Site so that you will
            always be aware of what information We collect, use and disclose. We encourage you to review this Policy
            from time to time so you will know if the Privacy Policy has been changed or updated. If you have any
            questions about the Policy, please contact us at
            <a href="mailto:robertbilal123@gmail.com?subject=Redirection from Privacy Policy Page">[support@e-commerce.com]</a>.
